## Features
- **Optimized for Performace** - Successfully computed 30,000 physics tails at 60 FPS in Studio without frame drop.
- **Smooth at Any Frame Rate** - Uses fixed timestep + linear interpolation for smoothness.
- **Customizable** - Easily configure the tail's stiffness and damping.
- **Scriptable Runtime Control** - Programmatically modify behaviours.
- **UGC Accessory Support** - Project's primary goal has been to work with tail accessories.
- **Custom Tail Support** - Works with non-accessory tails.
- **Custom Character Support** - Works with custom rigs and NPCs.
- **Dynamic Character Scaling** - Seamlessly handles changes in character scale.
- **Precedural Wag Animation** - Built-in idle wagging animation.
- **Character Forces** - Moves dynamically with character animations and movement.
- **Global Forces** - Reacts naturally to Roblox wind, gravity and custom global forces.
